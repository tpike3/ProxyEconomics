New parameters:
-company-policies: an angle between a global proxy and a global goal (basically a company level practice-angle)
-company-flexibility: the standard deviation of individual agent's practice angles around the company-policy during company initialization and inheritance.
-company-mutation rate: standard deviation of policy mutation during inheritance

The global goal is the societal goal of the whole industry (i.e. whatever people think they should be doing).
The global proxy is what companies compete on (i.e. profit).
Both are defined by the system level goal-angle. 

Between company competition works on the mean global-proxy performances of companies 
(i.e. the company-mean of the individual agent projections on the global proxy).
Company make no decisions:
- effort, proxy and goal values are emergent properties from the companies agents)
- company-policy emerges through company-level cultural evolution 
(companies stochastically go bankrupt if their global-proxy performance is insufficient and reproduce otherwise).
I assume this would have to be added as a kill_and_replace_company function in the model class?

Within company competition between agents works on individual performances toward the company policy 
(i.e. the projection of individual performance on the company policy vector).
This guides within company cultural evolution as previously. 
Within company decisions are based on individual proxy-performance (i.e. performance toward company policy)
and global goal performance.
